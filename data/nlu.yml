    - My everyday routine is same as always. I wake up, have breakfast, go to school, come back, do my homework, have dinner and then go to sleep.
    - My days are very similar. All I do is waking up, having breakfast, going to school, coming back home, doing homework then dinner and sleep.
    - My days are identical to each other. I do nothing outside of Waking up, having breakfast, going to school, coming back home, doing homework then dinner and sleep.
    - From waking up to going to bed at night I guess my every day is same. In the morning I have breakfast then go to school and come back, do my homework then dinner and then go to sleep
    - I guess my days are very alike. It includes waking up, having breakfast, going to school, coming back, doing my homework, having dinner and then go to sleep.
    - My days are not really different from each otherâ€¦.waking up, having breakfast, going to school, coming back home, doing homework then dinner and sleep.

    - I don't think my days are very different from each other. It's just about waking up, having breakfast, going to school, coming back home, doing homework then dinner and sleep.
    - I guess my every day is becoming very indifferent. Because I do nothing outside waking up, having breakfast, going to school, coming back home, doing homework then dinner and sleep.
    - I guess everyday it's the same happening on a loop...waking up, having breakfast, going to school, coming back home, doing homework then dinner and sleep.
    - My every day is repetition of each other because all I do is waking up, having breakfast, going to school, coming back home, doing homework then dinner and sleep.
    - I guess it's impossible to find any difference in my everyday routine. Waking up, having breakfast, going to school, coming back home, doing homework then dinner and sleep is all I do.
