  utter_shifting:
  - text: I can feel your sadness and misery.
  utter_believing:
  - text: Angela, maybe they say that to make you feel better.
  utter_bywhatprocess:
  - text: Yeah it does, its tough on you. I think others-parents and friends sense
      that and want to divert you to a positive direction.

  utter_moo_dh_appy:
  - text: Is there something that is bothering you?
  utter_af_fi_rmm:
  - text: Would you like to tell me a little more about it?
  utter_behaving:
  - text: I see. Is there anything particular that make you act so aggressively?
  utter_a_f_firm:
  - text: What is it?
  utter_puffing:
  - text: What did you do next?
  utter_yelled:
  - text: How does that make you feel now?
  utter_responding:
  - text: Now when you look back, what do you think could have been different in the way you reacted?
  utter_acting_properly:
  - text: This looks like an insight. Am I correct?
  utter_af_fir_m:
  - text: That is great Brian. Acknowledging your behaviour is the first step to changing it.
  utter_aff_irm:
  - text: I want to ask you a few questions.
  utter_m_affirm:
  - text: Apart from this one situation, would your friends, in general, describe you as a person of short temper?
  utter_de_n_y:
  - text: Okay. How exactly did you feel in this situation?
  utter_compelled:
  - text: I see. Would it be accurate for me to say that you react agressively when you are persuaded too much?
  utter_coachconsultation:
  - text: Do you also feel angry when someone disagrees with you?
  utter_d_eny:
  - text: Alright! Thank you Brian for answering all my questions with such patience.
  utter_den_y:
  - text: Now let us start by setting a goal. What would you like to work upon first?
  utter_unhappy:
  - text: Okay. You already have an insight and a willingness to work on it. That is you strength Brian.
  utter_see:
  - text: Do you know about assertive communication?
  utter_elaborate:
  - text: There are three ways to communicate Passive, Aggressive and Assertive.
  utter_affi_rm:
  - text: Passive people do no state their opinions and let others decide for them.
  utter_s_ee:
  - text: Aggressive people state their opinions but in an attacking way.
  utter_exactly:
  - text: Assertive people on the other hand, state their opinions while still being respectful to others around them.
  utter_ho_ow:
  - text: The simple motto is "I decide for me and you decide for you".
  utter_elucidate:
  - text: Instead of shouting, an assertive person would express their point clearly and confidently in a conversational tone.
  utter_give_it_a_shot:
  - text: That is good progress.
  utter_irate:
  - text: Would you like to try with me first?
  utter_ho_w:
  - text: Imagine I am persuading you a lot for attending an event that you don't want to. How will you react in an assertive way? Write it down here.
  utter_attending:
  - text: How did you do?
  utter_cant_saymuch:
  - text: Okay. Try saying it again but this time, add to it the way you feel when I ask you again and again to attend the event and give an alternative to what I could have done?
  utter_fathom:
  - text: I sense agression here. Do you?
  utter_bit:
  - text: Try rephrasing it again.
  utter_h_o_w:
  - text: I suggest you acknowledge the need of the other person and use words that are more empathic.
  utter_accompany:
  - text: How did you do?
  utter_a_cut_above:
  - text: And that is progress.
  utter_affi_r_mk:
  - text: Do you feel better?
  utter_willdo:
  - text: Why dont you give this technique a try then?
  utter_gr_ee_t:
  - text: Hi Sadie, it's nice to meet you How're you doing today?
  utter_fine:
  - text: I am doing just fine thank you! How can I help you today?
  utter_con_cerns:
  - text: What sort of troubles?
  utter_forlorn_equation:
  - text: That's terrible Do you want to elaborate on it?
  utter_anger_inherited:
  - text: That's awful! Have you found any way of dealing with it so far?
  utter_starting_point:
  - text: Have you thought about attending family therapy? It is something that has worked really well for a lot of families Since you are a family, you will be together for a long time, so working out the problems together can be helpful

  utter_isolating:
  - text: I am sorry to hear this. But this is only temporary. 
  utter_wecandothis:
  - text: Things take time. I am sure this situation will change. 
  utter_doesnotknow:
  - text: Well I will always be here for you. 
  utter_thanks_dg:
  - text: Maybe you should put yourself out there more. 
  utter_supposing:
  - text: Maybe not everyone. How old are you and what do you do?
  utter_lateteens:
  - text: Maybe engage in co-curricular activities?
  utter_affirm_ko:
  - text: And maybe talk to a counsellor if you have issues with social interactions.

  - text: Then try and put yourself out there. 
  utter_affirm_sure:
  - text: Was this helpful?(Yes)(No)

  utter_tease:
  - text: That's a true fear that you've shared.I appreciate it. Do you and your friends  make
      fun of each other ?
  utter_stayclose:
  - text: Jeff we sometimes build up things to be much bigger than they are.
  utter_bothered:
  - text: I'm saying you're right in feeling bad at the unfairness of it. Maybe just
      letting  it get to you a little too much.
  utter_clear:
  - text: How about take a shower,calm down and just talk about it with your parents
      at dinnertime.
  utter_complete:
  - text: Exactly,Jeff you're sharp and quick to understand.
  utter_takeplaceatschool:
  - text: Let's take one thing at a time. Right now just work on feeling calm and
      positive about yourself.

      more?

  utter_nerd:
  - text: I can understand-it does make you feel awkward in that moment.
  utter_pondered:
  - text: Has anyone brought it up after that day ?
